# TwitchPlays_TrainSimulator

These are the scripts I use to run Twitch Plays Train Simualtor on my stream. I originally hacked these together for my personal use and hence they are written in a very dirty fashion. I may clean them up at somepoint although for now I haven't had the time to dedicate to it. However due to popular request I have released the scripts. They come without any support / warranty and you'll need to know a bit of how to use Python and interfacing Windows DLLs via CTypes to get it up and running.

You'll need to edit config.py with your Twitch IRC credentials to allow chatters to control the train.
